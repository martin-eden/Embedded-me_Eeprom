EEPROM implementation after-thoughts

1

Register mapping is relatively sane

  Control
  Data
  Address

Workflow is that we're setting (Address) and (Data) (if we want to write)
and then touching read or write bit in (Control).

(Control) has weird bit 2 aka EEMPE. We need to set it along with "normal"
write bit 1 aka EEPE. I called that bit 2 "Going to write. Seriously".

Writing featurism

Just writing byte is too boring! Designer created three write modes:

  (Replace)
  (Set to 0xFF)
  (Only write zero bits)

And also introduced two-bit setting for this in (Control).

I can not easily imagine use case of (Only write zero bits).

Timings

Reading is instant, writing is thousands times slower.

According to datasheet (Replace) needs 3.4 ms per byte,
(Set to 0xFF) and that weird mode need 1.8 ms.

Stated storage endurance is 100K.
